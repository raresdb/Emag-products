#Butilca Rares

    This is a program that manages orders from 2 input files: orders.txt and product_orders.txt.
    The orders are represented by an ID and a number of products and the products are represented
by an order ID and a product ID. A product ID can be met more than once in an order, which means
that the product has been ordered in multiple quantity.
    The program has a number of product manager threads and the same number of order manager
threads. The product managers will manage one order at a time, while the product managers will look
over the products to be shipped, announcing the product manager how many products have been found.
If the number of products required is found, then both the order and the products will be printed
as shipped in the output files.

Check the Makefile for indications as to how to run the program.
